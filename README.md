# AFL-2020-Hackathon
Repo contains all my work for the Australia Sports Tech Week Hackathon. 
This was a 2 day hackathon and I was working by myself so my initial analysis is fairly limited (i will get around to expanding this because its definitely very interesting!).

Using model interpretability (with SHAP), I attempted to look at the differences in the winning game styles in 2020 compared to previous seasons.

Notebook contains all analysis, modelling and visualizations.

Tableau workbook contains dashboard to visualize model predictions for individual games and players.
